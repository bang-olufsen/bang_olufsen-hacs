[![Balance stereo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bang-olufsen/mozart-open-api/main/docs/media/balance_stereo.png)](https://www.bang-olufsen.com/en/dk/speakers/beosound-balance-stereo-set?variant=beosound-balance-gva-naturaloak-bundle)

The `bang_olufsen` integration enables control of some of the features of certain [Bang & Olufsen](https://www.bang-olufsen.com/) devices through Home Assistant.

This integration uses the [Mozart open API](https://bang-olufsen.github.io/mozart-open-api/)

## Compatible devices

Devices that have been tested and _should_ work without any trouble are:

- [Beoconnect Core](https://www.bang-olufsen.com/en/dk/accessories/beoconnect-core)
- [Beolab 8](https://www.bang-olufsen.com/en/dk/speakers/beolab-8)
- [Beolab 28](https://www.bang-olufsen.com/en/dk/speakers/beolab-28)
- [Beosound 2 3rd gen](https://www.bang-olufsen.com/en/dk/speakers/beosound-2)
- [Beosound A5](https://www.bang-olufsen.com/en/dk/speakers/beosound-a5)
- [Beosound A9 5th gen](https://www.bang-olufsen.com/en/dk/speakers/beosound-a9)

- [Beosound Emerge](https://www.bang-olufsen.com/en/dk/speakers/beosound-emerge)
- [Beosound Level](https://www.bang-olufsen.com/en/dk/speakers/beosound-level)
- [Beosound Theatre](https://www.bang-olufsen.com/en/dk/soundbars/beosound-theatre)
- [Beoremote Halo](https://www.bang-olufsen.com/en/dk/accessories/beoremote-halo)
- [Beoremote One](https://www.bang-olufsen.com/en/dk/accessories/beoremote-one)

### Beoremote One

Beoremote One remotes are added to Home Assistant through Mozart devices as they are paired.

Event entities are available for each of the compatible keys on the remote. To trigger these Event entities, enter the "Control" or "Light" submenu, and press any of the compatible buttons. Each button press will send a "press" and a "release" event. The functions in these submenus are also supported.

The favourite buttons correspond to the physical favourite buttons on the device.

### Beoremote Halo

Beoremote Halo support is still in active development, so several features are missing, and current features may change without any warning.

Feel free to open an [issue](https://github.com/bang-olufsen/bang_olufsen-hacs/issues) to request a feature or comment on an existing one.

The Halo can currently only be added through Zeroconf discovery. Afterwards, add a configuration to the Halo by entering the options by pressing the `CONFIGURE` button.

All actions have to be manually defined for each entity type, which is why not all entities work at this point.

Generally "wheel" events are handled by counting the number of detents in a "rotation" with a resetting timeout of currently 125ms and acting accordingly. This means that an action is called only when the wheel has been stationary for 125ms. This seems to be the most stable way to handle entities that are "slow" to change states.

#### Current features

- Add pages containing Home Assistant Entities as buttons
  - Support for Binary Sensor entities
  - Support for Button / Input Button entities
  - Support for Light entities
  - Support for Number / Input Number entities
  - Support for Sensor entities
  - Support for Switch / Input Boolean entities
- Delete pages
- Battery charging Binary Sensor Entity
- Battery Level Sensor Entity
- System statues Event entity (Can be used as a proximity sensor)
- Custom actions:
  - Get Halo configuration
  - Send notification to Halo
- Select or remove default Halo button

#### Missing features

These features have to evaluated further and are in no particular order.

- Modify pages
  - Modify buttons
- Support for more Entity types
- Entity filtering for config_flow
- Manual setup
- Create Event entity for button instead of selecting an existing entity

## Configuration

This integration can be added to a Home Assistant installation using [HACS](https://hacs.xyz/) by adding `https://github.com/bang-olufsen/bang_olufsen-hacs` as a [custom repository](https://hacs.xyz/docs/faq/custom_repositories/).

Afterwards, devices can be added to your Home Assistant installation manually by using the UI or by auto-discovery.

## Example setup and blueprints

Christian Klit has made a setup video for Home Assistant which includes this integration.
[![Setup video](https://img.youtube.com/vi/ju_gQDIme0w/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ju_gQDIme0w)

As can be seen in the video, Christian also provides several [automation blueprints](https://cklit.dk/index.php/category/blueprints/mozart/) for this integration on his website.

These include:

- Control lights using Beoremote One
- Control shades using Beoremote One
- Announce where music has been joined from (Beolink)
- Control scenes using Light and Control menu items on BR1 BT
- Trigger a scene, when alarm starts
- Show active Listening position and Sound mode on LG screen

Go to his website [cklit.dk](https://cklit.dk/) to see more information on the useful blueprints for Mozart and ASE based Bang & Olufsen products.

## Entities

This integration adds an array of different useful entities that are generated and added automatically upon setup, customized for the supported features of the device. Some of these features, such as `proximity sensor` and `home-control` are manually defined based on model name in the code, as they currently can't be determined in any other way.

## Getting Deezer URIs

In order to find Deezer playlists, album URIs and user IDs for Deezer flows, the Deezer website has to be accessed. When navigating to an album, the URL will look something like: <https://www.deezer.com/en/album/ALBUM_ID>, and this simply needs to be converted to: `album:ALBUM_ID` and the same applies to playlist, which have the format: `playlist:PLAYLIST_ID`.

Additionally a Deezer user ID can be found at <https://www.deezer.com/en/profile/USER_ID> by selecting the active user in a web browser.

## Getting Tidal URIs

To find Tidal playlists, album URIs and track IDs, the Tidal website has to be accessed. When navigating to an album, the URL will look something like: <https://listen.tidal.com/album/ALBUM_ID/>, and this needs to be converted to: `album:ALBUM_ID` and the same applies to playlists, which have the format: `playlist:PLAYLIST_ID`. Individual tracks can also be found by sharing the track and selecting the `Copy track link` method, which should yield a link with this format: <https://tidal.com/browse/track/TRACK_ID?u>, this can be played by extracting the track id `TRACK_ID`.

## Automations

"raw" WebSocket notifications received from the device are fired as events in Home Assistant. These can be received by listening to `bang_olufsen_websocket_event` and `bang_olufsen_halo_websocket_event` event types where `device_id` is used to differentiate devices.

### Physical buttons and sensors

Event entities are created for each of the physical "buttons" on your device. These buttons usually have their own behaviors, so using them for automations is not always ideal.

Available buttons:

- Bluetooth
- Microphone
- Next
- Play / Pause
- Favourite 1
- Favourite 2
- Favourite 3
- Favourite 4
- Previous
- Volume

All of these buttons support the following events:

- Release of short press
- Long press
- Release of long press
- Very long press
- Release of very long press

All devices except the [Beoconnect Core](https://www.bang-olufsen.com/en/dk/accessories/beoconnect-core) support device controls.

## Actions

### play_media actions

The Bang & Olufsen integration supports different playback types in the `media_player.play_media` action: playback from URL, activating a favourite, playback from a local file, playing a radio station, activating a Deezer flow and Deezer/Tidal playlists, albums and tracks. Additionally `announce` can be set to `True` to play TTS or files as an overlay.

  media_content_id: media-source://media_source/local/doorbell.mp3
  announce: true
  extra:
    overlay_absolute_volume: 60
```

Playing an overlay TTS with an offset volume

TTS messages can be quiet, so an offset is useful in this scenario.

```yaml
service: media_player.play_media
target:
  entity_id: media_player.beosound_balance_12345678
data:
  media_content_type: overlay_tts
  media_content_id: This is a test

```yaml
service: media_player.play_media
target:
  entity_id: media_player.beosound_balance_12345678
data:
  media_content_type: overlay_tts
  media_content_id: Dette er en test
  announce: true
  extra:
    overlay_tts_language: da-dk
```

_NOTE_: To easily obtain the media_content_id for a Deezer/Tidal track or B&O Radio station, you can start playing the content you wish to activate in an action call - the `media_id` attribute available on the `media_player` entity will provide the value to be used in the media_content_id field.
